# Chatspresso

Chatspresso is a SaaS startup idea I had. The idea was to develop a chrome extension that runs on your LinkedIn. When you navigate to another user's profile, the extension reads that user's profile, and generates a hyper-personalized outreach message
using generative AI.

The API directory has the python api that does the scraping of the LinkedIn profiles.
